# Azure-For-Everyone-Else
Easy to read guides on Azure resources

## Why
The cloud is a big place with an endless stream of buzzwords and jargon. You want to get started and know what something is without the marketing cruft. Azure has plenty of resources, offerings, and possibilities! I want to help you understand so you can build.

## How
I'll distill info how I view it, as a result anything I relay is at your discretion to take as fact. Please refer to official documentation if you need confirmation, but in general I am pulling information I find from docs, blogs, discussions, forums, and personal findings. The platform changes FAST so please heed dates I put on docs to see if they are even relevant anymore!

## Contribute
If you want to help please submit PRs and I will review them as soon as I can!
