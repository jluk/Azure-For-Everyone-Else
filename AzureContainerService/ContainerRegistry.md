# [Azure Container Registry] (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/) - 12/14/2016

What is a container registry? <br>
* You made a bunch of sweet containers, you need somewhere to put these beautiful things! Put them inside the registry, a shipping vessel for your containers.
* This is another resource in your Resource Group backed by an Azure storage account

What do I get for putting my babies here? <br>
* Reduced network latency
* No cost for ingress/egress
* Same old APIs you know and love with Docker
* Store Windows and Linux images

How much does it cost? <br>
* The registry is free, but you pay [base storage costs] (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/container-registry/)
