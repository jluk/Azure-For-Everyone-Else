# Azure Cloud Console

## Features
The Azure Cloud Console was built with the pains a developer goes through on a daily basis. The Azure platform has evolved over the years and we sincerely hope the next evolution makes developing on Azure easier, friendlier, and more enjoyable.
To achieve this we now offer a console and a predetermind amount of storage to every Azure user for free. By doing this we allow:
* CLI access anywhere with browser access
* Persistent storage
* Automatic authentication

Whether you are new to Azure or experienced with the platform, you can learn new commands or build new workflows to more easily create, manage, and update Azure resources.

## The Future
As we learn more about what our users enjoy, what they don't, and what they wish they had we will work diligently to evolve the Azure Cloud Console into an experience that feels like home for any developer.
In the near term we will be focusing on the CLI and Linux experience, however we will share relevant future plans for the PowerShell community as well so stay tuned!
