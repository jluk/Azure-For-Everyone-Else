# The Cloud - 12/14/2016
The cloud is basically a term referring to the ability to "rent" computers from other people. This is delivered to you via the internet so from any computer you can ask a computer stored somewhere else in the world to do things you want. The internet is fast enough now that it is almost like having the hardware in the same room as you!

## Where can I get it?
* Amazon Web Services
  * Started in 2006, first to market and holds largest market share
* Microsoft Azure
  * Started in 2010, second in the cloud wars today
* Google Cloud Platform
  * Started in 2011, darling of the tech community with strong big data/ML lineage

Each of these platforms offer strengths and weaknesses that will make one shine for your particular use case or need. Evaluate them accordingly and be hands-on, this is the best way to find out what deserves your business.

## The Future of Cloud
This space is still being defined and is susceptible for a wide range of audiences. Large scale computing is a necessity deemed by the common user through the expectation of immediate, secure, and intelligent applications. When it comes time for businesses to deliver this promise, it requires extensive discussion/negotiation/testing. As a result the platform choice can be spread across the business team, developers, and devops. Each audience will offer striking opinions that can often conflict and it is important to listen to each for they all have their own value.
